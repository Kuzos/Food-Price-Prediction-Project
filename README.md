# Food-Price-Prediction-Project
Objective: The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting food prices in a country experiencing a crisis.  

The file Final.ipynb includes the code and all necessary documentation, organized through an outline (table of contents) where each section is described. 

The dataset provided in the file wfp_food_prices_ukr.csv is the original dataset from the WFP Food Price Dataset.
The file Reindexed.csv contains the preprocessed dataset used for training the models.
